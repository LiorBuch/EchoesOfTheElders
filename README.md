## Motivation 🌠

Echoes of the Elders aim to be:

⭐ Unique - Relics have unique effects and interactions

⚖ Unapologetic - Relics are not afraid to be "unbalanced"

👑 Powerful - Receiving items should feel instantly rewarding

🚯 Clean -  No ammo, No durability, No boring ingredients or junk items Not all relics are ingredients, but all ingredients are relics

🤝 Coexist - Relics aim to apply "on-top" of existing items, and not make them obsolete

💅 Pretty - Whether by textures or custom effects and renderers

💭 Opinionated - if it isn't already obvious...

 

 

## Balance ⚖

this mod favors feeling/interactions over balance, in contrast to vanilla or even other mods in the ecosystem, one of the reasons this was created was because lately playing modded felt like every addition had to walk on eggshells just to fit/"make sense" inside of minecraft.

We were tired of thinking "whats the catch?" after reading an item description or just realising it had a 10 layer deep nested crafting recipe.

 

instead, this mod relies on-

 

## RNG 🎲

while this can be annoying while going for a specific item, the intention was to create an experience similar to a roguelite game, where items come at random, and each run feels different because of the random order in which the items are received, for example:

if you received an item that makes mining really easy, and you get that right at the start of the game, you can either skip the whole "getting a diamond pickaxe" game loop and divert resources to different areas instead, or when playing in multiplayer, causes "roles" to emerge, in this case you would be the miner in the party.

 

this mod wants you to feel smart, and wants to be abused or minmaxed by you.

 

 

Planned 💭
we plan on adding more relics, more relic combinations and synergies, and even a new mechanic that will let you test your newfound powers to the limits that minecraft sometimes even modded minecraft isnt able to provide.
