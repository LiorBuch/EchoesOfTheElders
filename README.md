<h3 style="text-align: center;">Echoes of the Elders</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 18px;">A mod about powerful artifacts and interesting interactions that aim to be broken!</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A picture is worth a thousand words</h2>
<p>before diving into the details, let's see some of the content in action</p>

<h2>Core Mechanics and Gameplay Loop</h2>
<h4>Stacked Items</h4>
<p>In this mod, many items (that you might not expect) are allowed to stack, stacked items gain additional stats/bonuses similar to mechanics found roguelike games where duplicate items are stacked for greater effect. Most stacked items also reward the player with an alternative texture (so you can show off😎)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Spirit Realm</h4>
<p>The new <strong>Spiritual Awakening Update🌸</strong>&nbsp;adds a new dimension - <strong>The Spirit Realm</strong>!</p>
<p><b>A dimension filled with cherry trees and a unique atmosphere, this dimension mirrors the terrain and day-night cycle of the overworld while always being lit - you can use this to your advantage to build inter-dimensional bases or to escape mob spawns while traveling at night.</b></p>
<p><b>This is where players will find most of the content added by the mod.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The spirit realm is home to structures containing&nbsp;<strong>Artifact Vaults</strong> - unbreakable* blocks that contain <strong>Powerful Artifacts</strong>, but require a <strong>Key</strong> in order to be opened!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Getting to the spirit realm</h5>
<div class="spoiler">
<p>Players need to scout a new entity added by the&nbsp;<strong>Spiritual Awakening Update🌸</strong> update - <strong>The Elderman:</strong></p>
<p><b>An enderman from a higher plane of existence, capable of traversing more dimensions than a normal enderman can.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LiorBuch/EchoesOfTheElders/master/design/screenshots/eldder%20man.png" alt="ElderMan" width="634" height="341" /></p>
<p><b>By felling this creature the player will come to possession of an <strong>Elder Prism</strong>:</b></p>
<p><b>a dimensional travel device, that allows travel between the overworld and the spirit world (and vice versa) by holding down and releasing the item for enough time, but be careful - the spirit realm has identical terrain to that of the overworld dimension, so you might want to reconsider using it while atop of a cool bridge base built across a ravine</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Obtaining Artifacts</h5>
<div class="spoiler">
<p><strong>Relics</strong> are obtained by unlocking <strong>Artifact Vaults</strong>&nbsp;found in the <strong>Spirit Realm</strong> using <strong>Keys</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Obtaining Keys</h5>
<div class="spoiler">
<p><strong>Keys</strong> are dropped from slain <strong>Spirit</strong> entities that are holding a key</p>

<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Echoes of the Elders</strong></span><strong> aim to be:</strong></p>
<p>⭐ <strong>Unique&nbsp;</strong>-&nbsp;Relics have unique effects and interactions</p>
<p>⚖ <strong>Unapologetic</strong> - Relics are not afraid to be "unbalanced"</p>
<p><strong>👑 Powerful</strong>&nbsp;- Receiving items should feel instantly rewarding</p>
<p>🚯 <strong>Clean -</strong>&nbsp; No ammo, No durability, No boring ingredients or junk items&nbsp;<span style="color: #ffcc00;">Not all relics are ingredients, but all ingredients are relics</span></p>
<p>🤝 <strong>Coexist</strong> - Relics aim to apply "on-top" of existing items, and not make them obsolete</p>
<p>💅 <strong>Pretty</strong> - Whether by textures or custom effects and renderers</p>
<p>💭 <strong>Opinionated</strong> - if it isn't already obvious...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Balance ⚖</h3>
<p>this mod favors feeling/interactions over balance, in contrast to vanilla or even other mods in the ecosystem, one of the reasons this was created was because lately playing modded felt like every addition had to walk on eggshells just to fit/"make sense" inside of Minecraft.</p>
<p>We were tired of thinking "what's the catch?" after reading an item description or just realizing it had a 10-layer deep nested crafting recipe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>instead, this mod relies on RNG to create varied gameplay</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>RNG 🎲</h3>
<p>while this can be annoying while going for a specific item, the intention was to create an experience similar to a roguelike game, where items come at random, and each run feels different because of the random&nbsp;<strong>order</strong> in which the items are received, for example:</p>
<p>if you receive an item that makes mining really easy, and you get that right at the start of the game, you can either skip the whole "getting a diamond pickaxe" game loop and divert resources to different areas instead or when playing in multiplayer, cause "roles" to emerge, in this case, you would be the miner in the party.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this mod wants you to feel smart and wants to be abused or min maxed by you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Planned 💭</h3>
<p>💭 <strong>More content</strong> - we plan on adding more relics, more relic combinations and synergies, and even a new mechanic that will let you test your newfound powers to the limits that minecraft sometimes even modded minecraft isn't able to provide.</p>
<p>💭 <strong>Going open source</strong> - we just went open-source 🎉 we wanted to give back to the community which we heavily relied on to get inspiration for complex behaviors and we love mods so much, we are happy that we can finally give back. but we do need to clean up the codebase a little so forgive the mess 😅</p>
<h3><br />License</h3>
<p>You can use this mod in your modpack</p>
<p>The mod in itself is open-source</p>
<p>The textures are under an&nbsp;<strong>all-rights reserved</strong> license, and you cannot use them in any sort of way outside of this mod</p>
